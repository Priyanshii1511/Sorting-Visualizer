Sorting refers to arranging the elements of an array or list in an ordered sequence.<br/>
# Sorting Visualizer<br/>
This application visualizes sorting algorithms with the help of colours which makes it easy to understand them. <br/>The algorithms implemented are:
1. Bubble Sort
2. Selection Sort
3. Insertion Sort
4. Merge Sort
5. Quick Sort
6. Heap Sort<br/><br/>Four colours have been used to showcase different steps being executed in the algorithm:
* BLUE: default<br/>It represents the default array which has to be sorted or the original positions of the array elements.
* YELLOW: comparison<br/>It represents the phase in which that array element is being compared.
* RED: incorrect<br/>It represents the incorrect position of the element from which it has to be moved.
* GREEN: correct<br/>It represents the correct and final position of an array element.<br/><br/>
## Other features
* **Speed of Algorithm**<br/>The speed of the algorithm can be altered. There are 5 speed levels (1 to 5) and by default it will be at 4.
* **Size of Array**<br/>The size of the array can also be changed. If the size is small, then the width of the bars will be large.
* **Generate New Array**<br/>New random array can be generated.<br/>
*When an algorithm starts, all these buttons are disabled so that it does not affect the implementation of the current algorithm.*<br/>
* **Time and Space Complexities**<br/>
The best, average and worst case time complexities as well as the space complexity of the algorithm running is displayed.
